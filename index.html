        <p> This is how I felt before starting to learn HTML. It seemed like a very difficult skill to learn. I am glad that I have taken the time to gain some skills in HTML. I think it will be fun to keep practicing and learning. </p>

        <p> Now that I have some skills behind me, I feel like I will be able to be more useful at work and in my other CS classes. I think each person should learn at least a little about HTML.</p>
